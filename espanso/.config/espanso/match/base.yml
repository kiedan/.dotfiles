# espanso match file

# For a complete introduction, visit the official docs at: https://espanso.org/docs/

# You can use this file to define the base matches (aka snippets)
# that will be available in every application when using espanso.

# Matches are substitution rules: when you type the "trigger" string
# it gets replaced by the "replace" string.
matches:
  # Simple text replacement
  - trigger: ":espanso"
    replace: "Hi there!"

  - trigger: "xem"
    replace: "mail@kiedan.com"

  - trigger: "xen"
    replace: "net@kiedan.com"

  - trigger: "xep"
    replace: "post@kiedan.com"

  - trigger: "xed"
    replace: "daniel@gottlos-auf-mutter.de"

  - trigger: "xgam"
    replace: "Gottlos auf Mutter"

  - trigger: "xeoa"
    replace: "East of Awesome"

  - trigger: "xue"
    replace: "https://eastofawesome.com"

  - trigger: "xug"
    replace: "https://gottlos-auf-muttter.de"

  - trigger: "xuv"
    replace: "https://vahruacloud.mooo.com"

  - trigger: "xlorem"
    replace: "Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum."

  # NOTE: espanso uses YAML to define matches, so pay attention to the indentation!

  # But matches can also be dynamic:

  # Print the current date
  - trigger: ":date"
    replace: "{{mydate}}"
    vars:
      - name: mydate
        type: date
        params:
          format: "%m/%d/%Y"

  # Print the current date
  - trigger: "xdate"
    replace: "{{mydate2}}"
    vars:
      - name: mydate2
        type: date
        params:
          format: "%Y-%m-%d"


  # Print the output of a shell command
  - trigger: ":shell"
    replace: "{{output}}"
    vars:
      - name: output
        type: shell
        params:
          cmd: "echo 'Hello from your shell'"
